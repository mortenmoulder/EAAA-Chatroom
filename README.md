# EAAA Chatroom
This whole project was an exam assignment. I chose to use the following frameworks and libraries:

* Ionic 3
* Angular 4 (or 2? or .io? nobody knows)
* TypeScript
* NodeJS
* Mongoose
* Express
* Socket.io

## Project information
I have two folders:

* Server
* Client

These contains the project files for each project. The `Client/` obviously contains Ionic, Angular, and so on. The `Server/` contains the NodeJS backend.

## Installation guide
Coming soon!
